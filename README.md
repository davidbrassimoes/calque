# Bugs

- Chain operations -> pressing "5 + 5 + 5 + 5" - "5 + 5 + 5 =" still returns 15 - wrong values are stored after that

- Can't introduce negative values

- keyboard support - this is implemented but it has a bug. for some reason, can't set displayed value - problem is that event triggers script from the top, so it runs the first useState(0) statement for displayed value

## To-Do

    - logs
